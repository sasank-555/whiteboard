# Backend TypeScript Project

This is an empty TypeScript backend project initialized with npm and TypeScript. You can start by adding your source files in the project root or in a `src` directory.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies (already done):
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
2. Build TypeScript files:
   ```sh
   npx tsc
   ```
3. Add your TypeScript code in the project root or in a `src` folder.

## Project Structure
- `package.json`: Project metadata and scripts
- `tsconfig.json`: TypeScript configuration
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md`: Copilot custom instructions
- `.vscode/tasks.json`: VS Code tasks (to be created)

## Scripts
- `npm run build` (add to package.json for building TypeScript)

## Next Steps
- Create your first TypeScript file (e.g., `index.ts`).
- Add build and start scripts to `package.json` as needed.
